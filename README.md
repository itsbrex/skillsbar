- **Settings** - choose whether to show What's New, switch between system, light, and dark appearance, and control the default sort from one place
- **Project workspace view** - manage trusted project folders in a dedicated screen with project skills, project agents, instruction files, health, conflicts, recents, pinning, rename, and reorder controls
- **Project instructions** - detect project-local `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.codex/AGENTS.md`, and pi's `AGENTS.override.md` files next to the trusted project
- **Instructions Hub** - one screen for global and project instruction files with Ready, Missing, Empty, and Unreadable states, plus open-or-create actions in your preferred editor
- **Project actions** - create collections from a project, open the project in Claude Code or Codex, and create `.claude/skills` with explicit consent when onboarding an empty project
- **Preferred editor** - choose an installed editor such as VS Code, WebStorm, Cursor, Zed, or Xcode for opening skills, agents, plugins, and global instructions

- **What's New** - spotlight skills and installed plugins changed in the last 7 days in a dedicated section
- **Usage stats** - tracks Claude Code, Codex CLI, Codex Desktop, and pi skill invocations in app-owned history, with 30d, 7d, and All ranges, daily/monthly heatmaps, quick hover totals by source, and ranked per-skill usage that still counts deleted skills
- **Skill Health** - a checkup screen in the footer Tools menu that flags invalid frontmatter, missing descriptions, duplicate triggers, missing collection paths, unreadable folders, and stale pins, with one-click cleanup actions
- **"New" indicator** - skills modified in the last 24 hours are marked with a blue badge
- **Detail views** - inspect rich metadata for skills, agents, and Codex plugins, including trigger commands, included skills, and file listings
- **Full content preview** - expandable section to view the raw SKILL.md body
- **Quick actions** - open items in your preferred editor, copy paths, reveal in Finder, and manage items from the list
- **Right-click context menu** - pin, add to collections, open, copy, and delete directly from the list
- **About & utilities** - view watched directories, library counts, and reveal watched folders directly in Finder from the About screen
- **Global hotkey** - toggle the popover from anywhere with `Option + Shift + S`
- **Keyboard navigation** - arrow keys and Return to browse and open items, `Esc` to go back or clear search, `Cmd + Left` to navigate back, `Cmd + K` for the Command Palette
- **Agent browsing** - browse Claude Code sub-agents (user and plugin) with model, color, and tools metadata
